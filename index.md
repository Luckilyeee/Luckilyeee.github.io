<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>

I am currently a PhD candidate in the Department of Computer Science at [Utah State University](https://www.usu.edu/cs/). I am fortunate to work with [Prof. Soukaina Filali Boubrahimi](https://www.usu.edu/cs/directory/faculty/boubrahimi-filali-soukaina). I received my M.S. in Computer Science at [Utah State University](https://www.usu.edu/cs/), where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Shuhan Yuan](https://www.usu.edu/cs/directory/faculty/yuan-shuhan). Prior to this, I obtained my B.Sc. in Software Engineering from [Wuhan Textile University](https://www.wtu.edu.cn/) in 2019.s.

My research centers around **machine learning, deep learning** and **data mining, explainable artificial intelligence** -- with a special focus on finding interesting patterns from real-life time-series data. My research interests include **time series classification**, **time series clustering**, **time series data augmentation**, **counterfactual explanation**, and **solar flare prediction**.
